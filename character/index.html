  <h1>Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
  <img src="img/sonic.png" alt="Sonic the Hedgehog">
  <p>Sonic is a blue hedgehog who can run past supersonic speeds. He is the protagonist of the 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog"><cite>Sonic the Hedgehog</cite></a>
    series. Usually, he will be tasked with foiling the various plots of Doctor Eggman,
    encountering hordes of enemies and dangerous areas as he progresses through the games.
  </p>
  <p>I like Sonic because of his flashy abilities and his carefree attitude. Seeing him blaze
    through enemies and stages is always a sight to see. Although he can be impatient and
    irritable at times (understandable with his speed), in the end he is always loyal to his
    friends and always wants to make things right.</p>
